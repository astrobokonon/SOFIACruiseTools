Built in python (probably requires >= 2.6, I use 2.7.something as my daily driver)

Python packages required:
(shouldn't have to install): re, os, sys, csv, copy, glob, datetime, itertools
Might have to install: pytz, numpy, scipy
Will likely have to install: astropy, PyQt4

Start it by:
python SOFIACruiseDirector.py

The other files need to be in the same directory but you shouldn't ever have to
touch them.

Usage:
Most buttons should be self explanatory.  'Open Flight Plan' will ask you for a
.mis file to load in and set parameters in the GUI accordingly.

But!  If you have a non-siderial target, you'll have to remove the extra line
underneath the "Target: ..." line in the leg header.  For example, a recent
FLITECAM flight plan contained.

Leg 8 (Asteroid with naif_id =2000016) Start: 09:03:38     Leg Dur: 01:02:48   Req. Alt: 42000 ft  
ObspID: 02_0066     Blk: OB_02_0066_07  Priority: C         Obs Dur: 00:52:48   
Target: Asteroid with naif_id =2000016 RA: 05h27m19.65s    Dec: 19d26m56.0s    Equinox: J2000.0    
NAIF ID: 2000016    
Elev: [37.1, 45.8]  ROF: [331.4, 326.5] rate: [-0.09, -0.07] deg/min  Moon Angle: 14

That "NAIF ID: ..." line is the one that has to go.  I should probably add a
check to do that automatically but I've obviously haven't.

It works best if you "Choose Output Filename" for the Cruise Director Log tab
before you put anything in it to make sure your first comments are saved.
Additionally, the "Data Log Output" file will only be written when new files
arrive in the list.  So if you set the output file first, then point it to the
directory, then it'll be guaranteed to write to the file the first run through.
Any notes that you add won't be added until it finds a new file and adds that
file to the list, which just needs some simple rewiring of the logic flow to
make that not a pain like that.

If you want to change the FITS headers that are queried, look at
SOFIACruiseDirector.py line 111 and change what you need for FORCAST there.  It
should be commented enough to read through briefly and at least find the
relevant section if you need/want to tinker with something but that varies
greatly since I wrote the bulk of this while transitioning to a night schedule
in the day or two before flights.
