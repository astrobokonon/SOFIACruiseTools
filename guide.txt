Guide to using CruiseDirector

CruiseDirector is a tool for recording notes during flights. It features:
- Tool to record notes thorughout the flight
- Reads in FITS headers from observations for easy checking
- Timers for current leg
- Timers for flight

To run the code, use:
python CruiseDirector.py

The first window that opens will allow for the setup of the code. There are six
fields to set up, but not all are required:

- Flight Plan: Select the .mis file for the current flight. The program will
  parse this for information about each leg. The instrument is also pulled from
  the name of this file.
- Instrument: In case the wrong instrument is read from the flight plan, set it
  here. The choice of instrument alters both the default FITS keywords to present
  and how the code searches for observations. FORCAST, FIFI-LS, EXES, and HAWC+
  (Ground) search for FITS files while HAWC+ (Flight) searches for grabme files. 
- Log Output: This is where the comment log will be stored. The default naming
  convention is "SILog_<utc date stamp>.txt". This is the only required field. 
- Log Data Output: This file will contain a csv version of the FITS keywords read
  in during the flight. 
- Data Location: Where observations will be read in from. FORCAST, EXES, and
  either HAWC settings will search for the corresponding file type in this
  directory only, while FIFI-LS searches for all FITS files in all subdirectories. 
- FITS Keywords: This opens a new dialog where the intial keywords to be
  monitored are defined. Each instrument has a defualt list, but new keywords
  can be added or removed. A personalized list can be curated then saved to file
  for record. This file can later be read in for quick personalization. 

Once the setup is complete, the main Cruise Director window opens. There are six
panels:

- Setup: This contains both the control buttons and the settings defined during
  startup. To change the setting, click the "Set Up" button. The "Start" button
  begins the flight timers and starts the collection of data, while "End" performs
  a final write of all log files and closes the program.
- Current Flight Progress: This contains two timers, the Mission Elapsed Time
  (MET) and Time Until Landing (TTL), both of which are initiated by the "Start"
  button.
- Flight Plan Information: Details each leg of the flight as parsed from the
  selected .mis file. The "Previous Leg" and "Next Leg" buttons can be used to
  step through the flight. These also control the leg timers. 
- World Times: The current time in both UTC and Local time zones. 
- Leg Timers: Timers for the current leg, as defined by the contents of the
  "Flight Plan Information" panel. Controls are present to start, pause, and
  reset the timer, as well as to control the counting direction (up or down).
- Logging: This is the main panel and has two tabs. 
    > Cruise Director Log: This is the open log for recording events/comments
      during the flight. It is saved to the file defined with the "Log Output"
      step of setup. There are quick buttons for common events, such as "Takeoff" and
      "Landing", as well as a text box to enter text into at the bottom. All comments
      are posted in the window of the tab as well as written to file as soon as they
      are made. 
    > Data Log: This window displays the FITS keywords read in during the flight.
      The rate at which the program looks for new files is controlled by the
      "Autoupdate every: " control. As new files are found, the table is populated with
      the files sorted by modification time. To alter the contents of any field, click
      in the cell and enter the modification. The corresponding FITS file is not
      altered, only the local log. To search for files immediately, use the
      "Force Update" button. Any time the table is altered, either by finding a new
      file or by changing a keyword property, the log file is written to the filename
      specified by the "Data Log" field. To force the write of a file, use the "Force
      Write" button. A blank line can be added to the log with the "Add a Blank Row"
      button. To delete a row, select the row by clicking on any cell in the desired
      row and use the "Remove Highlighted Row" button. To alter the keywords being
      used, use the "Edit Keywords..." button. This opens the same dialog shown during
      the setup step. Adding a keyword during the flight will only look for that
      keyword in all new files. It will not fill it for past files until "Force
      Update" is pressed. 

To end the program, use the "End" button. Upon confirmation of exiting, both the
Director's Log and the Data Log are written to file once again, then the window
is closed.
